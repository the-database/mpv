# Plan v2: Native mpv inference filter + C-ABI backend shim (no-host-round-trip GPU pipeline)

*Supersedes v1. All mpv file:line references verified against this checkout (the-database/mpv fork).*

## Changes from v1

1. **New: C-ABI inference shim (`libaji`) in a dedicated repo** — fixes the unaddressed mingw-mpv ↔ MSVC-TensorRT toolchain clash, kills the TRT version lock structurally, collapses vf_trt/vf_dml/vf_ncnn into ONE thin mpv filter (`vf_animejanai`), and enables a standalone CLI test harness.
2. **Phase 4 (NCNN) demoted** from scheduled phase to "deferred pending demand," and its premise corrected: `hwdec_vulkan.c` exists in-tree (v1 claimed mpv has no Vulkan decode). GLSL shaders documented as the non-NVIDIA fallback meanwhile.
3. **RIFE split into its own milestone (Phase 1.5)**, still inside the NVIDIA release gate.
4. **Numeric parity harness** (PSNR/SSIM vs goldens captured from the current vsmlrt pipeline) replaces eyeball-only verification — the pre-kernel reimplements a slice of zimg (chroma upsampling, matrix, range) and that's where silent quality bugs live.
5. **Bloat attack added:** evaluate TRT ≥ 8.6 hardware-compatible (Ampere+) + version-compatible prebuilt engines so most users never download `nvinfer_builder_resource` (~1.3 GB); builder becomes an optional download for Turing/Pascal.
6. **Output-format decision pinned to Phase 0** (RGB fp16 CUDA hwframe vs convert-back-to-YUV), with the FFmpeg `hwcontext_cuda` sw_format caveat made explicit.
7. **Sync-copy rationale corrected** (decoder pool lifetime/exhaustion, not "tearing").
8. **lavfi alternative documented** as a considered escape hatch — `f_lavfi.c` already passes hw frames, devices, and `vf-command` into libavfilter graphs; mpv already auto-inserts `bwdif_cuda` today, proving the CUDA-filter→render handoff in-tree.
9. **Windows frontend decided: keep mpv.net** (libmpv swap-in). Linux ships standalone forked mpv.
10. **Timelines made realistic:** NVIDIA milestone ~3–4 months (was 2–2.5); reference implementation reframed as feasibility evidence (screenshots), not a recipe.

## Context

Today's runtime pipeline is `mpv (mpv.net) → vf=vapoursynth → .vpy → Python (animejanai_core) → vsmlrt → vstrt.dll (TensorRT)`. Motivations to leave vs-mlrt:

1. **TensorRT version lock** — vstrt.dll is ABI-linked to a specific TRT build.
2. **Bloat** — the vs-mlrt CUDA archive is several GB.
3. **No host round-trips** — decode, upscale, and render must stay in GPU memory.

**Decisive finding (verified):** VapourSynth's frame model is host-memory only. `vf_vapoursynth.c:141-172` (`mp_to_vs`/`mp_from_vs`) maps only software YUV formats, and `filters/f_autoconvert.c:276` force-inserts `mp_hwdownload_create` when a hw frame meets a software-only filter. No VapourSynth-based design can satisfy the requirement. The inference must move into mpv as a native `mp_filter` operating on GPU hwframes (the `vf_d3d11vpp.c`/`vf_vavpp.c` pattern).

**Reference "implementation" ("mpv-v6", `C:\Users\jsoos\Downloads\mpvzero`):** inspected 2026-06-10 — the six PNGs are an *architecture document* (diagrams, build-flag tables, perf claims), not screenshots of a working build, and some numbers are implausible (~0.15 ms for a 2x TRT upscale). Its own memory layout shows **pinned host buffers + DMA + `nvdec-copy`** — i.e. that design routes every frame through host memory, exactly what this plan eliminates. Treat it as inspiration only: keep its mpv.conf tuning candidates (`swapchain-depth=3`, `display-resample`, `vulkan-async-compute/transfer`), ignore its perf table, do not cite it as validation. The real in-tree validation is mpv's existing lavfi-CUDA path (`f_auto_filters.c:108` auto-inserts `bwdif_cuda` on CUDA frames). Two ideas retained on their own merits: (a) a synchronized GPU-side copy out of the decoder ring; (b) CUDA Graphs capturing the whole pre→infer→post chain (~0.05 ms launch vs ~1–2 ms).

**Why the sync copy (corrected rationale):** the NVDEC surface pool is fixed-size; an inference filter that holds frames for pipelining (and RIFE's N/N+1 buffering) starves or deadlocks the decoder. Copy-on-arrival decouples frame lifetime from the decoder ring. "No host round-trips + synchronized" is the target, not literal zero-copy. The invariant to preserve: pre-processing, inference, and post-processing all happen on the same accelerator with no CPU intervention — never "convert format in C real quick."

**In-tree proof the handoff works today:** mpv already auto-inserts the libavfilter CUDA filter `bwdif_cuda` (`filters/f_auto_filters.c:108`) — CUDA frames already flow filter→vo_gpu-next in production. The generic pool helper `mp_update_av_hw_frames_pool` (`video/mp_image_pool.c:364`) is already CUDA-aware (`filters/f_hwtransfer.c:246`). The render side maps any sw_format generically (`video/out/hwdec/hwdec_cuda.c:178-187`) via the CUDA↔Vulkan interop (`hwdec_cuda_vk.c`).

**Decisions locked:**
- Synchronized sync-fence copy model; NVIDIA/TensorRT first, DirectML later, NCNN deferred pending demand.
- RIFE stays a release requirement, sequenced as its own milestone (Phase 1.5).
- **Single mpv filter (`vf_animejanai`) + C-ABI inference shim (`libaji`) in a dedicated repo** (e.g. `the-database/animejanai-inference`).
- **Windows keeps mpv.net** (forked libmpv swapped in); **Linux ships standalone forked mpv**.

## Architecture: one thin filter + a C-ABI shim

```
FFmpeg demuxer → NVDEC decode → IMGFMT_CUDA frame
  → vf_animejanai (mpv fork, mingw-built):
      sync-fence copy out of decoder ring
      → calls libaji shim via C ABI (dlopen/LoadLibrary)
         [shim: NV12/P010→RGB norm NCHW kernel → TRT infer → NCHW→output kernel,
          all captured in one CUDA Graph, multi-stream, fp16]
      → emits IMGFMT_CUDA hwframe from its own AVHWFramesContext pool
  → vo_gpu-next / libplacebo (Vulkan) via hwdec_cuda_vk: HDR, color, final scaling
  → display
```

**Why a runtime C-ABI boundary (not just a shared source module):**
1. **Toolchain:** mpv Windows builds are mingw-w64/clang (GNU ABI); TensorRT is MSVC C++ ABI. They cannot link directly. CUDA handles (`CUcontext`, `CUstream`, `CUdeviceptr`) cross a C ABI trivially; TRT's C++ classes don't cross a GNU/MSVC boundary at all.
2. **Kills the TRT version lock structurally** — swap shim+TRT without rebuilding mpv.
3. **One mpv filter forever** — DML/NCNN become new shim implementations (ORT already has a C API); the mpv-side surface exposed to upstream rebase churn stays minimal.
4. **Standalone CLI test harness** — raw YUV in → shim → raw out, diffable against the current pipeline without a player in the loop.

**Shim API sketch (C, versioned):**
```c
aji_ctx *aji_create(const aji_create_params *p);   // CUcontext, animejanai.conf path, cache dir, log callback
int  aji_select_chain(aji_ctx*, int w, int h, double fps, int slot); // conf chain match; builds/loads engine
int  aji_infer(aji_ctx*, const aji_frame *in, aji_frame *out, void *cu_stream);      // device ptrs + strides
int  aji_infer_pair(aji_ctx*, const aji_frame *in[2], double t, aji_frame *out);     // RIFE
const char *aji_stats_json(aji_ctx*);              // for the stats overlay
void aji_destroy(aji_ctx*);
```

**Division of labor.** The shim owns everything CLI-testable: `animejanai.conf` parsing, chain selection (`min_px/max_px/min_fps/max_fps` port of `run_animejanai_with_keybinding`), engine cache (CRC-of-settings filename **+ TRT version string in the hash**), trtexec orchestration, pre/post CUDA kernels, CUDA Graph capture, stats. The filter owns everything mpv-shaped: registration, options, `vf-command` handling, hwframe pools, the sync-fence copy, frame buffering for RIFE, PTS fabrication, hr-seek skip, publishing stats to Lua.

**The pre-kernel is the quality hotspot.** It is not "RGB→NCHW" — it's NV12/P010 → chroma upsampling (filter quality matters for an upscaler's input) → BT.601/709/2020 matrix, limited/full range → normalize → NCHW. This reimplements a slice of zimg in CUDA; verified numerically (see Verification), not by eye.

**Alternatives considered (kept for the record):**
- *Self-build vstrt.dll + strip downloads (~1 week):* solves version-lock + bloat, stays host-round-trip. Remains the Phase 0 fallback.
- *Custom libavfilter CUDA filter:* mpv's lavfi bridge already passes `hw_frames_ctx` (`filters/f_lavfi.c:489`), loads hwdec devices into graphs (`f_lavfi.c:553-570`), and forwards `vf-command` (`f_lavfi.c:810-834`). Pros: ffmpeg-CLI testability, stable public API, reusable in transcode pipelines. Cons: maintain an FFmpeg fork instead. Decision: mp_filter in the mpv fork (already an accepted cost, carrying `150a4b6dba`); the shim keeps a later lavfi port cheap — this is the escape hatch if mpv-internal churn ever bites.
- *GLSL user shaders (Anime4K/ArtCNN-class):* documented fallback for non-NVIDIA users until/unless a DML/NCNN backend ships. No TRT-class models, no RIFE.
- *Cheap in-place win:* `use_cuda_graph=True` in `core.trt.Model` (animejanai_core.py:143) — **do immediately regardless**, independent of this plan.

## Where the work happens (three repos)

1. **The mpv fork — this checkout** (`the-database/mpv`): `video/filter/vf_animejanai.c`, registration, build wiring. Already carries the hr-seek patch `150a4b6dba` ("vf_vapoursynth: fast seek for ML upscalers"), whose `get_hrseek` infrastructure in `filters/f_output_chain.c/h`, `filters/filter.h`, `player/playloop.c` is filter-agnostic — **reuse it in vf_animejanai** for the same drop-pre-target-frames behavior.
2. **New shim repo** (`the-database/animejanai-inference`): `libaji` core + `aji-trt` backend (MSVC + TRT + CUDA kernels), CLI harness, MSVC/CUDA CI, versioned releases bundling shim + TRT runtime.
3. **BuildMpvUpscale2xAnimeJaNai**: assembler rewrite (Phase 2), config/keybinding migration.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — De-risk spike (GO/NO-GO), ~2–3 weeks
Day 1, before any code: smoke-test the handoff with `--vf=lavfi=[scale_cuda=1920:1080]` on an nvdec-decoded file — this exercises the exact CUDA-frame-filter→vo_gpu-next path.
- Skeleton `vf_animejanai.c` from the `vf_d3d11vpp.c` template: accept `IMGFMT_CUDA`, allocate output pool via `mp_update_av_hw_frames_pool` (`vf_d3d11vpp.c:473` pattern), run a hardcoded prebuilt engine single-stream, emit `IMGFMT_CUDA`. Register in `vf_list[]` (`filters/user_filters.c:83-109`), add to `meson.build` behind a feature flag (pattern at `meson.build:1409-1412`).
- **Prove the toolchain boundary:** mingw-built mpv `dlopen`s an MSVC-built shim DLL sharing `CUcontext`/`CUstream` across the C ABI. (Strict C ABI: no C++ types, no CRT ownership crossing the boundary; allocator stays on one side.)
- **Pin the output format:** (a) RGB(A) fp16 CUDA hwframe — verify FFmpeg `hwcontext_cuda` supports it as sw_format (8-bit RGB0/BGR0 are supported; fp16 likely needs a one-line FFmpeg-fork patch — cheap, the Windows build compiles FFmpeg from source anyway), mpv-side mapping is format-generic (`hwdec_cuda.c:178-187`); or (b) post-kernel back to NV12/P010/YUV444P16. Decide with 10-bit/HDR sources in mind; 8-bit RGB silently caps them.
- **Capture golden outputs now** from the current vsmlrt pipeline (per model × a few sources incl. 10-bit) while it still runs — these become the parity-harness reference.
- Measure ms/frame 1080p→4K with a Compact engine; confirm no `hwdownload`/autoconvert insertion (verbose log), GPU residence throughout, no tearing.
- **Gate:** if the output-hwframe/render handoff or the toolchain boundary can't be made clean, stop and fall back to self-built vstrt.dll + stripped downloads.
- **GATE CLOSED 2026-06-10: GO.** Both slices passed. WSL: shim chain 3.77 ms/frame (1080p→4K fp16, RTX 5090), mpv headless decode→infer→emit ~160 fps, parity PNGs correct. Windows: mingw mpv.exe + MSVC aji.dll crossed the C ABI in production shape (TRT 10.8 from the v3.2.0 package), 2.78 ms/frame harness, Win↔Linux output PSNR 69.3 dB, fullscreen display playback via gpu-next/Vulkan with zero hwdownload in the log, user-confirmed smooth/clean/upscaled (1920×1080 NV12→4K and 1400×1080 P010→2800×2160 both exercised).

### Phase 1 — Production filter + shim (NVIDIA), ~5–7 weeks
- Shim: pre/post CUDA kernels (matrix/range/chroma-siting correct per frame metadata), CUDA Graph capture of the full chain, multi-stream context pool, conf parsing + chain selection port, engine cache (CRC + TRT version), on-first-play `trtexec` build, stats JSON.
- **PHASE 1 CLOSED 2026-06-11.** All of the above landed except multi-stream, which is **deliberately deferred with data**: the chain runs 3.2 ms/frame (1080p→4K, RTX 5090) ≈ 310 fps against a 24–60 fps playback budget, and unlike vsmlrt (which used `num_streams` to hide VapourSynth/Python per-frame latency) the native path has no host hops to overlap. mpv's filter model is single-frame pull; N-in-flight would add N frames of latency for zero realtime benefit at current model costs. Revisit for RIFE (doubled output rate) or if a future model exceeds ~30 ms/frame. CUDA Graphs: captured (bit-identical output, auto-fallback, `AJI_NO_GRAPH=1` opt-out); perf-neutral on the 5090 (~0.2 ms of kernels in a 3.2 ms chain; launch overhead invisible), kept for CPU-bound setups. Kernel parity vs VS/zimg: pre 107.8–123.3 dB, post bit-exact–120 dB, resize 78–83 dB; end-to-end vs vsmlrt on the same engine 70.5–75.7 dB (max 1 LSB). Slot 0 = bypass (filter never leaves the chain — profile rebuilds race with queued vf-commands); keybindings migrated on sibling branch `native-filter-migration`; hr-seek pre-target skip via refqueue drop gate; dedicated non-blocking stream (ffmpeg's CUDA ctx leaves stream NULL → TRT default-stream syncs, no graph capture).
- **CLI parity harness (deliverable):** Y4M/raw in → shim → PSNR/SSIM vs Phase 0 goldens. Catches colorimetry bugs eyeballs can't.
- Filter: options via the standard priv-struct + `m_option` table (pattern `vf_d3d11vpp.c:86-95`, `796-812`, entry `814-829`); runtime slot switching via the `command` hook (`filters/filter_internal.h:98`, `MP_FILTER_COMMAND_TEXT` arrives from `vf-command`, `player/command.c:7019-7043`; example handler `f_lavfi.c:810-834`); sync-fence copy; hr-seek skip reusing `150a4b6dba` infra.
- Keybindings: `input.conf` profiles move from `vf=vapoursynth=…` to `vf=animejanai=slot=N` / `vf-command`. Preserve Shift+1/2/3, Ctrl+1–9, Ctrl+0 off.
- Stats overlay: filter publishes shim stats via an mpv property (or keeps writing `currentanimejanai.log`) so `animejanaistats.lua` / Ctrl+J keep working.

### Phase 1.5 — RIFE milestone, ~2–3 weeks
- Filter mode buffering N/N+1, emitting multiple output frames per input. In-tree precedent for >1-out-per-1-in with fabricated PTS: deinterlace field doubling via `MP_MODE_OUTPUT_FIELDS` (`video/filter/refqueue.c:175-202`, second field at `pts + frametime/2`).
- Shim `aji_infer_pair` with RIFE shapes (pad-to-mod-32), engine via the same trtexec path. Replaces `rife_cuda.py`/`vsmlrt.py`.
- The hard part is VFR timestamps, PTS monotonicity, and interaction with hr-seek soft reset — that's why it's its own milestone. **The Phase 2 release gate includes RIFE parity.**

### Phase 2 — Build & distribution overhaul (BuildMpvUpscale2xAnimeJaNai), ~2–3 weeks
- `Program.cs`: **remove** `InstallPortableVapourSynth`, `FixPythonPth`, `InstallPythonDependencies`, `InstallPythonVapourSynthPlugins`, `InstallVapourSynthMiscFilters`, `InstallVapourSynthAkarin`, `InstallVsmlrt`, `VsMlrtVersion`/`VapourSynthVersion` constants, `vsmlrtModelsPath` cleanup. **Add:** fetch forked mpv build + shim release + TRT runtime + CUDA redistributables. **Keep:** `InstallRife` (models move under `animejanai/onnx/rife/`) and `InstallYtDlp`.
- **Windows frontend: keep mpv.net** — swap in the forked `libmpv-2.dll` (the filter ships inside libmpv). Linux: standalone forked mpv.
- **Bloat attack: evaluated and REJECTED (2026-06-12).** Prebuilt engines only work as (a) static per-resolution — leaves unfixable holes for unanticipated resolutions once the builder is dropped (no upscaling for those files), or (b) dynamic-shape + hardware-compatible — ruled out by direct measurement (dynamic engines' perf drop is too large; this is also why static became the default trt_engine_settings). The per-SM builder resources ship (package 3.6 GB); the async build UX (pause/narrate/auto-resume + persistent timing cache, ~10-60 s first play) is the mitigation.
- Rework `deploy.yml` (pre-existing `dotnet-version: '8.x'` vs `net10.0` mismatch).

**NVIDIA milestone = Phases 0 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 — COMPLETE 2026-06-12.**

**Release gate redefined (2026-06-12): the next release is v3.4.0 and ships only at feature parity with 3.3.x** — replacing the pipeline must not lose existing features. In-gate: Phase 3 (DirectML backend — CODE-COMPLETE 2026-06-12), fractional RIFE factors (DONE
2026-06-12, mpv `5b26e84ffb`), and the benchmark rework (DONE 2026-06-12, sibling `6baef56` —
**no editor changes needed**: the editor's Benchmark button shells
`benchmarks\animejanai_benchmark_all.bat` in a console, a file-based contract; the bat now
drives a native benchmark.ps1 over the configured backend, bundled testsrc2 seeds, built-in
slots 1010/1011, writing benchmark.txt like 3.3.x; ConfEditorVersion bump unnecessary).

**3.3.0 vs native, measured 2026-06-12 (RTX 5090, same V3.1 SPANF3 models, same clips, 500
frames, end-to-end playback: 3.3.0 = ffms2+VS/vspipe fps, native = hw-decode mpv --untimed,
log-window fps):** TensorRT Balanced 480x360 886→936 / 640x480 481→651 / 768x576 312→492 /
720p 176→278 / 1080p 73.7→111.9 fps (1.5-1.6×); Performance 1109→1075 / 507→818 / 338→648 /
176→379 / 77.2→174.7 fps (up to **2.3×**). DirectML (3.3.0 vsort vs native aji_dml):
720p 104→123 / 112→185, 1080p 43.4→55.3 / 49.8→**91.9** fps (1.3-1.9×). The native side runs
ONE frame in flight vs VS's 8-deep pipeline and still wins everywhere except ~480x360 parity
(per-frame fixed costs) — the pipelining backlog item lifts exactly that. In-package
benchmark tool (inference-only, what users see): TRT 1080p Bal 150 / Perf 281 fps; DML 66 /
126 fps. Out-of-gate: Linux (Phase 5 — never supported, purely additive), NCNN (stays deferred: with DirectML at parity its unique audience on a Windows package is ~nil).

**TRT 11 migration — DONE 2026-06-12** (shim `69b12a1`, builder `2f6d2f8`; user folded it into the
expanded v3.4.0 scope): the runtime API surface compiled UNCHANGED against 11.0.0.114; the work
was trtexec's weak-typing flag removals — settings sanitize at cmdline-build when
NV_TENSORRT_MAJOR≥11 (drop --fp16/--bf16/--int8/--best/--buildOnly, --inputIOFormats/
--outputIOFormats (the fp16: value prefix no longer parses), --tacticSources (cuDNN/cuBLAS
enum values gone); --workspace→--memPoolSize), CRC still hashes the original string; the RIFE
template became --stronglyTyped from the fp16 models (works on 10 and 11, validated both).
Results: parity vs 10.16 Y 59.5 / UV 68.9 dB max 1 LSB, 4:4:4 flat output BIT-IDENTICAL, RIFE
strongly-typed builds + runs, CUDA graphs capture, perf: the WSL isolation on the V3
Performance model measured ~6% slower (3.42 vs 3.21 ms), but the in-package benchmark on the
SHIPPING V3.1 models (Windows, 5090, all 10 engines rebuilt on TRT 11) measures **+2% to +11%
FASTER across every resolution/model** (1080p: Balanced 150→155.9, Performance 280.9→286;
768x576 Performance +10.6%; full per-cell tables in BENCHMARKS.md) — no release-blocking
perf concern; and **cold engine builds drop
~60 s → ~10 s** — the first-play UX transforms. Windows runtime = vs-mlrt v16.test1
(nvinfer_11 import lib generated via dumpbin/lib; slim DLL set proven: nvinfer_11 + plugin +
onnxparser + builder resources + cudart + trtexec — lean/dispatch/cuDNN/cuBLAS not needed).
CAVEAT: v16.test1 is a pre-release — recheck for stable v16 before the package release. Debug
note: an mpv exit mid-build kills the trtexec child BY DESIGN (quit-doesn't-stall) — short
untimed test runs produce truncated build logs with exit 1; not a failure.

### Phase 3 — DirectML backend (Windows non-NVIDIA) — recon complete 2026-06-12, design locked

**Parity bar (verified against 3.3.x source):** `backend` is a **global** key in `[global]` of
animejanai.conf — case-insensitive, `directml` → DML, `ncnn` → NCNN, anything else (incl. absent)
→ TensorRT. 3.3.x DML ran `core.ort.Model(fp16=True, provider="DML")` on **CPU frames**
(`hwdec=auto-copy-safe`), implicit adapter 0, no engine cache, and **RIFE on DML was supported**
(`BackendV2.ORT_DML(fp16=True)`) — so `aji_dml` must implement `aji_infer_rife` for parity.
NCNN stays deferred: conf value `ncnn` aliases to DML with a log warning (its audience is
non-NVIDIA Windows, which DML serves; pre-DX12 GPUs fall out of support).

**Runtime stack (locked):** ONNX Runtime **1.24.4** (`Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML` — the
last DML-flavored release; DML is in "sustained engineering", no 1.25+/1.26 DML packages exist)
+ `Microsoft.AI.DirectML` **1.15.4** (last release). `onnxruntime.dll` ~16.5 MB +
`DirectML.dll` ~17.7 MB → `animejanai/inference/`. Both redistributable (MIT + DirectML redist
license §1(a), Windows/Xbox only); ship both ThirdPartyNotices. **Load order matters:**
DirectML.dll must be loaded (full path, own dir) *before* onnxruntime.dll (vsort win32.cpp
precedent).

**Session recipe (vsort-proven + ORT docs):** `ORT_SEQUENTIAL` + `DisableMemPattern` (both
mandatory for the DML EP); EP append via `OrtDmlApi` (`GetExecutionProviderApi("DML",
ORT_API_VERSION)`); run the **first inference twice** (DML command-list warmup — vsort's
"replay" workaround); at most one `Run()` in flight per session. Steady-state lever:
`ep.dml.enable_graph_capture` (requires static shapes, all-DML partition, stable bindings —
exactly our case; probe in the spike, fall back if rejected). GridSample (RIFE) is in-EP HLSL,
opset ≤ 20, 4D only; **fp16 GridSample needs Native16BitShaderOps else it falls back to CPU** →
RIFE models keep fp32 IO for v1 (capability parity; fp16 conversion at package-build time is a
later optimization). Upscale models: our shipped ONNX are already fp16 → feed fp16 tensors
directly (type must match model IO exactly).

**Device:** create our own ID3D12Device + IDMLDevice + DIRECT queue on the **same adapter as
mpv's D3D11 device** (match by LUID), pass via `SessionOptionsAppendExecutionProvider_DML1`.
Strictly better than 3.3.x (implicit adapter 0 regardless of decode device).

**Data path (GPU-resident — beats 3.3.x's decode→CPU→GPU→CPU→GPU round-trip):**
1. Filter: decoder D3D11 textures are **not shareable and not implicitly synchronized**
   (`vf_amf.c:493` precedent) → `CopySubresourceRegion` decode slice → filter-owned
   `ArraySize=1` texture with `MISC_SHARED_NTHANDLE`, `Flush()`; output-pool textures likewise
   need MiscFlags set on the `AVD3D11VAFramesContext` before init.
2. Shim: `OpenSharedHandle` per unique texture (cached); D3D12: `CopyTextureRegion`
   texture→buffer (PLACED_FOOTPRINT per NV12/P010 plane) → HLSL compute pre-kernel (port of
   kernels.cu math: NV12/P010 → fp16 RGB NCHW; BT.601/709/2020, limited/full, left/center/
   topleft siting) → bind via `CreateGPUAllocationFromD3DResource` + IoBinding → `Run()`
   (submits to our queue) → HLSL post-kernel → `CopyTextureRegion` buffer→output texture.
   DML tensors must live in D3D12 **buffers** (not textures), hence the texture↔buffer copies
   around the kernels.
3. Sync: shared `ID3D11Fence`/`ID3D12Fence` pair — D3D11 signals after the input copy, the
   D3D12 queue waits; D3D12 signals after the post-kernel, the filter's D3D11 context waits
   before releasing the frame downstream.

**Filter:** `mp_refqueue_add_in_format` ×2 (CUDA + D3D11), runtime dispatch on the frames-ctx
device type; D3D11 branch requests the IMGFMT_D3D11 hwdec device, stages frames vf_amf-style;
`aji_frame.plane[0]/[1]` carry `ID3D11Texture2D*` + subresource index on the DML path
(documented per-backend meaning); `cu_stream` is NULL. **API v5:** create params gain
`void *d3d11_device`.

**Dispatch (honors the `backend=` key):** `aji.dll` becomes a thin dispatcher — parses
`[global] backend` via the existing aji_conf, `LoadLibraryEx`es sibling **`aji_trt.dll`** /
**`aji_dml.dll`** from its own directory, forwards the whole C ABI. Filter unchanged
(`lib=aji.dll`). nvinfer DLLs never load on AMD/Intel machines. Direct mode (engine_path —
harness) → TRT. POSIX: `dlopen("$ORIGIN/libaji_<backend>.so")`.

**hwdec coordination:** the input format must match the backend (nvdec→CUDA for TRT,
d3d11va→D3D11 for DML). A tiny lua startup hook reads `[global] backend` from animejanai.conf
and sets `hwdec` accordingly before playback (mpv.conf keeps the nvdec default).

**No engine cache for DML** → no build monitor, no trtexec, no timing cache. Session creation
(seconds) happens inline in configure; revisit async creation only if the spike shows >3 s.

**fp16 RIFE models SHIPPED (2026-06-12, `ded603c` + sibling `7e83a2a`, release
`models-rife-fp16-1`):** all 47 rife onnx converted by tools/convert_rife_fp16.py — fp16
everywhere except an fp32 island around the GridSample grid math (whole-graph fp16 measured
32 dB vs the TRT reference: fp16's ~1e-3 ulp quantizes the normalized sampling grid 1-2 px;
conv-only islands were SLOWER than fp32 — per-conv casts dominate). Numbers (5090):
DML 13.8→**11.1** ms/interp 1080p, 55.4→**41.0** ms 4K, **43.9 dB** vs TRT (fp32 baseline
48.0, zero bias); TRT engines from fp16 onnx ≡ fp32-built engines (62.2 dB) — and are the
strongly-typed input **TRT 11 requires**, so that migration's model work is done. Package:
rife dir 1011→507 MB (~3.6→~3.1 GB total); builder downloads one 307 MB asset instead of 27
vs-mlrt archives. Slot-5-class 4K upscale+RIFE 2x is now ~49 ms vs the 41.7 ms budget —
closer but still drops at 4K (fine at 1080p output); remaining lever: (2) DML graph capture
(`ep.dml.enable_graph_capture`) — legal now that IO is bound to stable GPU buffers, cuts
per-op dispatch; needs a parity re-run to validate freshness.

**Post-gate perf/quality backlog** (consolidated from an external code review 2026-06-12 +
own levers; none are gate items):
- **Pipelined inference (both backends) — DONE 2026-06-12** (shim `78169f4` ABI v7 + mpv
  `7e936eb60c`). Shape it landed in, vs the sketch: completion **tickets**
  (aji_flush/aji_done/aji_wait — TRT: CUevent ring on the caller's stream with an in-order
  completed watermark; DML: a NEW queue-private done-fence, because the existing shared
  fence is also signaled from D3D11 input handoffs and a fence's completed value is its
  max, so a later D3D11 signal would falsely complete an earlier marker). No per-slot
  tensor buffers or per-slot graphs needed — successive aji_infer calls are
  stream/queue-ordered, which makes the shared chain/stage buffers safe; the filter-side
  ring is just {src-identity, out, ticket} and the refqueue's future-ref window
  (queue-depth − 1; option default 3, max 4) supplies the input read-ahead AND keeps
  decoder surfaces pinned until emission waits each ticket (no extra refs, no
  cuLaunchHostFunc — emission blocks on the head ticket with N+1/N+2 already queued). DML
  extras: command allocators retire by fence tag (free/busy lists) instead of
  rewind-after-the-per-frame-wait; mpv's D3D11 input staging texture became a per-slot
  ring (cross-API copies are unordered). RIFE took the documented-synchronous-exception
  branch (scene decision = CPU readback; depth forced 1). Validated bit-identical
  (framemd5 depth 1 vs 3: TRT incl. RIFE slots + graph replay on WSL, DML 2168 frames on
  the host); seeks/loops/runtime slot switches clean. End-to-end best-of-3 (BENCHMARKS.md
  has the tables): TRT +6–16% Balanced / +11–34% Performance, DML +30–36%; the in-package
  tool is unchanged by design (synchronous harness) and reproduces the TRT 11 rows = no
  regression. The 4K RIFE budget item is NOT lifted by this (RIFE stays sync) — still on
  the DML graph-capture lever. Stream-priority experiment: stays closed (the stream
  topology didn't change — same single infer stream).
- **yuv444p16 output — DONE 2026-06-12, and it is the DEFAULT** (user decision: parity with
  the reference's forced 4:2:0 subsample is a floor, not a ceiling). Shim `0471775` (API v6:
  aji_frame plane[3]; planless pre444/post444 — simpler AND faster than the resampling
  4:2:0 path; 16-bit csp scales; scd 16-bit norm; graph staging 3-plane; RIFE consumes 4:4:4
  directly, its chroma upsample disappears) + mpv `fd70a56105` (output-444 bool, default
  yes on CUDA; DirectML stays 4:2:0 — no planar 16-bit 4:4:4 DXGI pool format). Validated:
  Y ±1 LSB vs 4:2:0, chroma means match with sub-8-bit precision retained, RIFE-on-444
  interpolating, cuda[yuv444p16] maps natively through gpu-next/Vulkan with zero downloads.
  Costs: ~+300 MB pool VRAM at 4K (option-controllable); conversions got faster. Gotcha for
  headless logs: --vo=null hw-downloads ALL hw formats (no interops) — not a regression
  signal. (RGBAF16 re-checked and still rejected: hwcontext_cuda lacks it.)
- **Passthrough ref-forwarding — DONE 2026-06-12** (mpv `git log`-adjacent commit): bypass
  forwards the decoder frame ref (both hw paths); RIFE chains keep the copy (decoder-ring
  pinning rationale). **Stream priority — evaluated, closed without code:** the review
  suggested cuStreamCreateWithPriority(leastPriority) "so inference preempts the VO" — that
  is backwards, and the actionable space is empty either way: VO/decoder streams run at
  default priority 0, lowering the inference stream is a no-op against priority-0 peers, and
  raising it would let inference preempt display-deadline mapper copies (jank). Revisit only
  inside the pipelining work where the stream topology changes.

(The same review also flagged the packaged `hwdec=auto-copy-safe` — already found and fixed
in 3f; re-checking it surfaced the REAL adjacent gap, fixed in `c82742f`: the package pins
`gpu-api=vulkan,auto` and mpv has no D3D11→Vulkan interop, so backend=DirectML on any
Vulkan-capable machine would have hw-downloaded every output frame; the backend lua now
pairs the render API with the backend — verified both ways, zero hwdownload.)

**Packaging:** builder fetches the two NuGets (nupkg = zip) at pinned versions → `inference/`;
licenses into third-party notices; parity harness gains a DML backend run (PSNR thresholds vs
CUDA goldens — cross-backend fp16 differences expected); engine-monitor lua needs no change
(DML never emits "Building" lines).

**Phase 3 CODE-COMPLETE 2026-06-12** (display verification pending). Slices: **3b** spike
(`3b4d2e7`: 5090 CPU-tensor 1080p→4K Performance 14.0 ms, Balanced 20.5 ms; graph capture +
CPU tensors silently replays STALE data — only legal with IoBinding) → **3c** dispatcher split
(`1bcc4e3`) → **3d** upscale path (`eea14a3`: IoBinding on a shared DIRECT queue, HLSL kernel
ports, shared D3D11 textures + fence handoff, synchronous v1; parity vs CUDA backend NV12
~61 dB max 1 LSB / P010 67-71 dB max 3 LSB(10b); 7.6 ms/frame 1080p→4K — half the CPU-tensor
spike; API v5 = `d3d11_device` create param) → **3d.2** RIFE on DML (`9ea3fda`: pad/window/
SCDetect-reduction kernels, fp32 session; vs TRT: identical scene decisions, interp ~48 dB,
zero bias — fp16-built TRT vs fp32 DML flow diverges at motion edges) → **3e** filter
IMGFMT_D3D11 (mpv `0ad86f2aa4`: device adoption by frame type, vf_amf-style staging, local
SHARED|NTHANDLE output pool, CUDA driver load no longer fatal; vendored aji.h v5 `794ba466c8`)
→ **3f** packaging (sibling `519f0b8`: InstallOrtDml ships onnxruntime.dll + DirectML.dll +
license, aji release zip = aji/aji_trt/aji_dml + harnesses [v0.1.0 asset refreshed], overlay/
deps/notices updated; `animejanai_backend.lua` sets hwdec from [global] backend — also fixed
mpv.conf's leftover 3.3.x `hwdec=auto-copy-safe`, which had been forcing a hidden CPU
round-trip on the TRT path). End-to-end verified headless both backends via pkg-mock with
lua-driven hwdec (d3d11[nv12]→DirectML 4K / cuda[nv12]→TensorRT 4K).

### Deferred pending demand — NCNN/Vulkan backend
- Not scheduled. v1's premise was outdated: `video/out/hwdec/hwdec_vulkan.c` exists (FFmpeg ≥ 6.1 Vulkan decode, all vendors) — if this is ever built, it's `hwdec=vulkan` + NCNN sharing the device/images, not a decode bridge. Audience is Linux ∩ non-NVIDIA ∩ realtime-AI-upscaling; until demand shows up, document GLSL shaders as the non-NVIDIA fallback. Migration shim: `backend=ncnn` in animejanai.conf routes to DML with a logged warning (Phase 3).

### Post-gate: distribution slimming — one download + a component manager

*Analysis 2026-06-12; decision deferred until the v3.4.0 gate work (#29) is done — may fold
into 3.4.0, may follow it.*

**Measured package decomposition (3.61 GB dry build):** TensorRT pack ~2.19 GB (61% — of
which 1.82 GB is per-SM engine-builder resources spanning 8 GPU generations, individually
111–433 MB); RIFE models 0.96 GB (27%); core ~0.46 GB (13% = player + editor + upscale onnx
(14 MB!) + dispatcher + ORT/DirectML runtime (35 MB — ships in every configuration, it is
also the NVIDIA fallback)). A DirectML-only install is ~460 MB — an 87% download reduction
for exactly the audience most likely to bounce off 3.6 GB.

**Decided direction (user, 2026-06-12): NOT multiple download SKUs** — vs-mlrt's wall of
variant downloads is the named anti-pattern. Instead: **one download + an "AnimeJaNai
Manager"** (likely a repurposed/extended AnimeJaNaiUpdater, which already does manifest
parsing + GitHub release downloads + 7za extraction):

- Manager inspects the hardware (DXGI adapter enum; NVIDIA SM generation via device-id
  table / nvml / the shim's own gpu_token machinery) and recommends components.
- Installs/uninstalls component packs hosted as separate release assets: TensorRT runtime,
  **per-SM builder-resource packs** (the natural unit — a Blackwell user needs sm120+ptx
  ≈ 480 MB, not all 1.82 GB), RIFE models.
- Hardware changes: re-run the manager → new recommendation (new SM pack on a GPU upgrade,
  TRT pack on an AMD→NVIDIA move); existing clean_stale_engines already handles the old
  GPU's engine cache.
- The dispatcher split makes this safe at runtime: missing backends are per-DLL, nothing
  loads until selected.
- Open design option for when this lands: ship core with DirectML as the working default so
  FIRST PLAY works on every GPU minutes after a ~460 MB download, with the manager offering
  the TensorRT pack to NVIDIA users as an upgrade ("best performance") — turns the 3.6 GB
  wall into a progressive enhancement. **Still open — decide at release time** (the packs +
  manager below work against both full and slim cores).

**IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-12** (package repo `a0e80f6`, branch native-filter-migration):

- Builder `--packs` emits `component-{trt-runtime,rife,trt-smXX,trt-ptx}.7z` + `packs.json`
  (per-pack file lists, bytes, package_version) from the built tree; archives are rooted at
  the install dir so extraction over an install IS installation. `--packs-only [dir]` emits
  from an existing tree without rebuilding (validated against the TRT 11 pkg-mock:
  trt-runtime 171 MB / rife 441 MB / trt-ptx 197 MB / trt-sm120 214 MB compressed).
- AnimeJaNaiUpdater = the Manager: `--components` (GPU detect + installed/available/
  RECOMMENDED listing), `--install <pack>`, `--remove <pack>` (per-file deletion from
  packs.json; engine caches and user files untouched), `--auto` (install whatever the
  detected hardware recommends). NVIDIA detect via NVML P/Invoke
  (`nvmlDeviceGetCudaComputeCapability` → sm75…sm120 pack name, unpublished SM → trt-ptx;
  no nvml.dll → non-NVIDIA → DirectML-in-core recommendation). State in `components.json`
  at the install root, inferred from disk for pre-manager installs; a version guard refuses
  packs published for a different package_version (update first, then install components).
  `ANIMEJANAI_PACKS_DIR` env var overrides the release lookup for local testing.
- `animejanai_backend.lua` warns (log + one-shot OSD on first file-loaded) when the
  configured backend or an enabled RIFE chain needs a missing pack, naming the exact
  Manager command — covers: no nvinfer_11.dll (trt-runtime), no builder resources (soft —
  cached engines still run), `chain_*_rife=yes` with an empty rife dir.
- deploy.yml builds with `--packs` and uploads the component archives + packs.json as
  release assets alongside the full package, overlay, and manifest.
- End-to-end validated on the pkg-mock install: detect (RTX 5090 → sm120), infer-from-disk,
  remove → reinstall round-trip (47 rife files), `--auto` no-op when satisfied and
  reinstall when not, all four lua hint cases.
- **AnimeJaNai Manager GUI shipped 2026-06-12** (editor repo, tag 0.1.0, asset
  `AnimeJaNaiManager-portable-x64.zip`): the config editor is renamed AnimeJaNai Manager,
  moved to the install root next to mpvnet.exe, and grew a Components tab driven by
  `AnimeJaNaiUpdater --components --json`. Recommendations are highlighted (never
  pre-checked); RIFE is an optional default-on-fresh-installs choice; backend toggles and
  per-chain RIFE checkboxes are component-aware (TensorRT disabled when unusable, conf
  auto-flips to DirectML with a recorded `backend_auto_fallback` marker and flips BACK to
  TensorRT the moment it is installed — manual backend clicks clear the marker). First-run
  dialog installs the whole recommended set in one click (3.3.0 "prepackaged" parity).
  Package repo consumes it: builder extracts to root, Ctrl+E launches it, lua hints point
  at it.
- Still pending at release time: slim-core-vs-full default decision (above), real
  release-asset flow for packs (needs a published package release with pack assets).

### Phase 5 — Config editor & Linux packaging, ~1–3 weeks, after NVIDIA milestone
- Linux distribution: self-contained tarball/AppImage built on the oldest supported Ubuntu LTS; documented build-from-source path; skip Flatpak/Snap/Docker for v1; never bundle the NVIDIA kernel driver; verify TRT redistribution under NVIDIA's SLA (vs-mlrt publicly redistributing TRT DLLs in GitHub releases is precedent it's tolerated — still verify).
- Config editor: document config-file editing for Linux first; an Avalonia rewrite of `AnimeJaNaiConfEditor` is **not committed** until the NVIDIA build has shipped and demand is shown.

## Critical files

mpv fork (this checkout):
- `video/filter/vf_d3d11vpp.c` — primary template (pool at :473, options :86-95/:796-812, entry :814-829); `video/filter/vf_vavpp.c` secondary.
- `filters/user_filters.c:83-109` (`vf_list[]`) — registration; `meson.build:1409-1412` — conditional build pattern.
- `video/mp_image_pool.c:364` (`mp_update_av_hw_frames_pool`, already CUDA-aware via `filters/f_hwtransfer.c:246`).
- `video/out/hwdec/hwdec_cuda.c`, `hwdec_cuda_vk.c` — render handoff.
- `filters/filter_internal.h:98` + `player/command.c:7019-7043` — `vf-command` plumbing; `filters/f_lavfi.c:810-834` example handler.
- `video/filter/refqueue.c:175-202` — multi-output PTS precedent for RIFE.
- Commit `150a4b6dba` — hr-seek infra to reuse (`filters/f_output_chain.c/h`, `filters/filter.h`, `player/playloop.c`).
- Anti-templates: `video/filter/vf_vapoursynth.c:141-172`, `filters/f_autoconvert.c:276`.
- New: `video/filter/vf_animejanai.c`.

Shim repo (new): `aji.h` (C ABI), `aji-trt` backend, pre/post kernels, CLI harness.

BuildMpvUpscale2xAnimeJaNai: `Program.cs`; `animejanai/core/animejanai_core.py`, `animejanai_config.py`, `rife_cuda.py` (port → delete); `profiles/*.vpy` (delete); `portable_config/input.conf`, `mpv.conf`, `scripts/animejanaistats.lua` (migrate).

## Verification

- **Day 1:** `--vf=lavfi=[scale_cuda]` handoff smoke test passes before writing code.
- **Phase 0:** verbose log shows no `hwdownload`/autoconvert insertion; GPU memory residence end-to-end; no tearing; ms/frame at 1080p→4K Compact ≈ current vsmlrt path; toolchain boundary proven.
- **Parity harness (Phase 1, continuous):** PSNR/SSIM vs vsmlrt goldens per model incl. 10-bit/BT.2020 sources — colorimetry, range, chroma siting.
- **Phase 1:** Shift+1/2/3 and Ctrl+1–9 cycle correctly; chain selection matches old behavior per resolution/fps; first-play engine build works; Ctrl+J stats populate.
- **Phase 1.5:** frame count multiplies correctly; PTS monotonic; A/V sync drift ≈ 0 over 10 min; seeking clean with hr-seek skip.
- **Phase 2:** clean-machine install; A/B watch vs current shipped release (smoothness, HDR, 10-bit); per-frame budget vs the reference's ~7–18 ms; headroom at 60 fps.

## Risks

- **Phase 0 unknowns** (narrower than v1, given the in-tree `bwdif_cuda` precedent): our own output pool + the toolchain boundary. Gate fallback: self-built vstrt.
- **C-ABI discipline:** no C++/CRT objects across the mingw↔MSVC boundary; one side owns each allocation.
- **FFmpeg fork patch** may be needed for fp16 RGB sw_format in `hwcontext_cuda` (only if RGB-out is chosen).
- **RIFE** VFR/PTS complexity — contained as its own milestone.
- **Prebuilt hw-compatible engines** are Ampere+ only — keep the optional builder download for older GPUs.
- **mpv internal API churn** on rebases — exposure minimized to one thin filter + the small hr-seek infra patch.
- **mpv.net is in maintenance mode** — coupling is only the libmpv swap; revisit if it breaks against newer libmpv.
- **TRT redistribution license** — verify before Phase 2 despite the vs-mlrt precedent.
- **No working reference exists** — "mpv-v6" turned out to be a design document whose memory layout is host-roundtrip (`nvdec-copy` + pinned DMA); estimates assume building and proving everything ourselves.

## Removed at the end

VapourSynth runtime, Portable Python, `vsmlrt.py`, `vstrt.dll`/`vsort.dll`/`vsov.dll`/`vsncnn.dll`, the `vsmlrt-cuda/` blob, MiscFilters/Akarin/ffms2, all `.vpy` shims, the `animejanai/core/` Python tree. Replaced by: forked mpv (libmpv for mpv.net on Windows, standalone on Linux) + `libaji` shim + TRT runtime + the native filter.
